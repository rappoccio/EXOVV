comment: | 
  CERN-LHC.Measurements of the differential jet cross section are presented as a function
of jet mass in dijet events, in bins of jet transverse momentum, with and without
a jet grooming algorithm. The data have been recorded by the CMS Collaboration
in proton-proton collisions at the LHC at a center-of-mass energy of 13\TeV and
correspond to an integrated luminosity of 2.3\fbinv. 
The absolute cross sections show slightly different jet
transverse momentum spectra in data and Monte Carlo event generators
for the settings used. Removing this transverse momentum dependence,
the normalized cross section for ungroomed jets is consistent with the
prediction from Monte Carlo event generators for masses below 30\% of
the transverse momentum. The normalized cross section for groomed jets
is measured with higher precision than the ungroomed cross
section. Semi-analytical calculations of the jet mass beyond leading
logarithmic accuracy are compared to data, as well as predictions at
leading order and next-to-leading order, which include parton
showering and hadronization. Overall, in the normalized cross section,
the theoretical predictions agree with the measured cross sections
within the uncertainties for masses from 10 to 30\% of the jet
transverse momentum.
