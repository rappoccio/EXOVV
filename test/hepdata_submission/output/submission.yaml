comment: Measurements of the differential jet cross section are presented as a functionof
  jet mass in dijet events, in bins of jet transverse momentum, with and withouta
  jet grooming algorithm. The data have been recorded by the CMS Collaborationin proton-proton
  collisions at the LHC at a center-of-mass energy of 13\TeV andcorrespond to an integrated
  luminosity of 2.3\fbinv. The absolute cross sections show slightly different jettransverse
  momentum spectra in data and Monte Carlo event generatorsfor the settings used.
  Removing this transverse momentum dependence,the normalized cross section for ungroomed
  jets is consistent with theprediction from Monte Carlo event generators for masses
  below 30\% ofthe transverse momentum. The normalized cross section for groomed jetsis
  measured with higher precision than the ungroomed crosssection. Semi-analytical
  calculations of the jet mass beyond leadinglogarithmic accuracy are compared to
  data, as well as predictions atleading order and next-to-leading order, which include
  partonshowering and hadronization. Overall, in the normalized cross section,the
  theoretical predictions agree with the measured cross sectionswithin the uncertainties
  for masses from 10 to 30\% of the jettransverse momentum.
